                    Let’s first take a moment to remember the 90s – the Ninja Turtles, and the Transformers, and the Ghost Busters! This was a time when Saturday mornings were spent glued to the television with a bowl of sugary goodness and ice-cold milk. Where the prize in the cereal box actually meant something and lunchboxes mirrored your spirit animal.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Sitting down to watch these adventures unfold was just the start, but the real fun began by taking the adventures offscreen and into your own hands. There were tons of ways to connect to your favorite characters through the plethora of themed products that hit the shelves and sparked your imagination. Needless to say, the 90s were a time to be remembered and 9 to 5 Warriors aims to recapture all of its magic. It does this by becoming the remake of a 90s cartoon you never got as a kid, but deserve as an adult. It gives you an excuse to play with your food and bring boring office supplies to life. 
                </p>
                <p>
                     9 to 5 Warriors is the “Saturday morning cartoon” for both the new generation and the Toys R’ Us kids who never grew up.

He’s a daydreamer who uses his creativity to command imaginary battles to avoid the mundane reality that lies outside his cubicle. He’s created a troop of soldiers he calls Water Cooler Commandos lead by the fearless Major Eraser, an embodiment of his alter ego. They wage war against the rotten Breakroom Bandits - which was all fine and well until the event that brought them to life, putting Alan in the middle of the very war he created.</p>

He’s a natural leader who never wavers from doing what’s right. And that’s the challenge. An eraser can rub itself out of existence trying to fix every mistake it comes across. He and the Water Cooler Commandos take the fight into after hours and will stop at nothing to prevent Custard’s campaign for total office domination.</p>

His heart is colder than the Frappe originally ordered with him. After all, being tossed away after just one bite will do that to a donut. Custard was the first to realize the power of Jensei, the Japanese energy drink that created them all and the life source to keep his jelly core contained. Now he is out for vengeance on every wasteful employee of McMillan Agency. He will stop at nothing to raise an army of the half-eaten to take over the whole wide office. </p>

                    Sometimes extraordinary things happen to extra-ordinary people. Ask Alan McMillan. His life used to be pretty routine – punch into work, make a few sales calls, daydream about the cute receptionist, you know? Normal. Sure, his habit of making action figures out of leftover lunches and office supplies might be a little off-putting to some, but no one really hung out in his cubicle long enough to notice.</p>

                    <p> Alan preferred it this way and kept his favorite figures hidden in a desk drawer waging an imaginary war between food and office supply soldiers. That is, until a freak accident involving his favorite Japanese energy drink and a surge protector sparked them to life. Now, Alan is caught between a very real battle for total office domination - one that threatens to drag him out of the comfortable confines of his vivid imagination and into a reality where paper balls, rubber bands and thumb tacks are threatening his way of life.

                        Unfortunately, in today’s world the TV, once the focal center of a home, now just adorns the walls. Our eyes are now exposed to an onslaught of smaller, smarter screens. Most of the shows we watch are “on demand” and the setting in which we watch them is no longer our living rooms. With so many destinations and viewpoints, the playground for content has changed, however, the concept of content hasn’t. We’re still forcing 23-minute episodes into web format, interrupting stories with unrelated ads, and following rigid 3 act structures. Media consumption has changed, and content needs to evolve to change with it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        9 to 5 Warriors wants to meet the viewer where they are by creating content made for the medium, not by being conformed into it. 9 to 5 Warriors aims to deliver an exciting vertical format that breaks the traditional 23-minute episode down to story arcs perfectly suited for consumption in between day to day activities. Catch the Water Cooler Commandos around the actual water cooler or see what the Break Room Bandits are up to on your lunch break. Stories should be short, engaging and available when and where the viewer wants. Viewers should be able to follow the characters they connect with most and choose their own adventures. But most importantly, viewers should be able to take the adventure into their own hands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This doesn’t mean that long format episodes are dead. But 9 to 5 Warriors, as a series, will utilize these stories to keep the adventures going in between each season.

                    Products have gone from tangible to downloadable, but real connections come from real life interactions. Experiences for kids now depend on countless hours of binge-watching sessions with no real break to appreciate the most creative time in their lives.

                <p>
                    Too many imaginations are held hostage as kids holding on to iPads. Trading collectible cards or liberating a new action figure from their cellophane and cardboard packages is what built the unbreakable bonds we felt with our Stretch Armstrongs and G.I. Joes. That’s what creates a nostalgic generation. 
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Television programs from the 90s were made for merchandising. The shows themselves were essentially long commercials aimed at selling products, earning the global toy market upwards of 88.8 billion worldwide and 25.5 billion in the US alone. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    9 to 5 Warriors wants to take part in that share by reintroducing the excitement of building on a story by building with your hands. We plan to market the type of creativity and imagination that makes toys great again. Both of these ideals are benchmarks of a fulfilling childhood, and 9 to 5 Warriors will be the segue that appeals to children and adults old enough to remember that feeling.
